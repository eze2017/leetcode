| Joseph       | 100    | 
| Isabella     | 101    | 
+--------------+--------+
<strong>Explanation</strong>
- Departments with IDs 100 and 101 each has a total of 4 employees, while department 107 has 3 employees. Since both departments 100 and 101 have an equal number of employees, their respective managers will be included.
Output table is ordered by dep_id in ascending order.

### **SQL**

<!-- 这里可写当前语言的特殊实现逻辑 -->

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT dep_id, COUNT(1) AS cnt
        FROM Employees
        GROUP BY 1
    )
SELECT emp_name AS manager_name, t.dep_id
FROM
    T AS t
    JOIN Employees AS e ON t.dep_id = e.dep_id AND e.position = 'Manager'
WHERE cnt = (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM T)
ORDER BY 2;
```
